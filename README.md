# BuscadorFrutas
 The YouTube channel "eddy" made a video called "BUSCADOR en TIEMPO REAL con JAVASCRIPT" where he made a fruit finder, since I didn't fully understand its js code; I decided to make my version of his code in a way that I understand and done by me, where I can add and remove fruits, although this works with "Enter" and not in real time like his.
